Given the information that the bonding curve has virtual token and SOL reserves, starts at 30 SOL and 1,073,000,000 tokens, and maintains k = 32,190,000,000, we can derive the bonding curve formula based on the XYK model:

### Initial Reserves and Constant
- Initial SOL reserve (R_SOL): 30 SOL
- Initial token reserve (R_token): 1,073,000,000 tokens
- Constant product (k): 32,190,000,000

### XYK Model
The XYK model is based on the constant product formula:
R_SOL * R_token = k

Given the initial reserves, the constant k is:
30 * 1,073,000,000 = 32,190,000,000

### Bonding Curve Formula
To maintain this invariant, any change in the reserves should adhere to this constant product relationship.

### Price Calculation
The price at any point on the curve can be derived as:
Price = R_SOL / R_token

Given the current reserves, the price can be adjusted as tokens or SOL are added or removed, ensuring the product remains constant.

### Adding/Removing Tokens or SOL

#### Adding/Removing SOL
When adding ΔR_SOL to the SOL reserve:
(R_SOL + ΔR_SOL) * R_token = k
R_token = k / (R_SOL + ΔR_SOL)

When removing ΔR_SOL from the SOL reserve:
(R_SOL - ΔR_SOL) * R_token = k
R_token = k / (R_SOL - ΔR_SOL)

#### Adding/Removing Tokens
When adding ΔR_token to the token reserve:
R_SOL * (R_token + ΔR_token) = k
R_SOL = k / (R_token + ΔR_token)

When removing ΔR_token from the token reserve:
R_SOL * (R_token - ΔR_token) = k
R_SOL = k / (R_token - ΔR_token)

### Example Calculation
Suppose we want to calculate the price after adding 10 SOL to the reserve:
- Initial reserves: R_SOL = 30, R_token = 1,073,000,000
- Added SOL: ΔR_SOL = 10
- New SOL reserve: R_SOL + ΔR_SOL = 40
- New token reserve: R_token = k / 40 = 804,750,000
- New price: Price = 40 / 804,750,000 ≈ 4.97 x 10^-8 SOL per token
